# Advent of Code 2017

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com) challenges by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz).

Writing these solutions have significantly aided my efforts to learn C++ and have often forced me to "look ahead" in my study to more advanced language facilities.

For anyone reading this, I appreciate any and all suggestions that may improve my understanding of the various facilities I've used. Of course, since I'm just learning please keep suggestions limited to improvements on HOW to better utilize a given header rather than rewriting a whole solution using some bleeding-edge pattern.
